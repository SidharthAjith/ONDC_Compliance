Compliances under the Guidelines on Digital Lending dated 2 September 2022<span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="src-1089241155_Annexure-K-A.-Compliances-under-the-Guidelines-on-Digital-Lending-dated-2-September-2022"></span></h3><p>1.1 The Digital Lending Guidelines prescribe the compliance requirements on REs (i.e. all banks and NBFCs) in relation to their DLAs and the DLAs of their LSP which include the following:</p><p><strong>(a)</strong> An RE / lender is required to ensure that their DLAs and DLAs of their LSPs also display detailed information about the loan products which may include particulars such as eligibility criteria, features, documents required, steps on how to apply for the loan products and indicative list of fees and charges, interest and gradation of risk in relation to determination of the interest percentage.</p><p><strong>(b)</strong> RE / lender must ensure that their DLA or the DLA of the LSP include particulars of customer care and grievance redressal, links to the privacy policy and terms and conditions as well as any other customer facing policy. A link also needs to be provided to the website of the RE / lender where such policies can be viewed at a prominent single place for ease of accessibility.</p><p><strong>(c)</strong> RE / lender must prominently publish the list of their DLAs, LSPs engaged by them and DLAs of such LSPs along the work performed by such LSPs on their website and DLA.</p><p><strong>(d)</strong> RE / lender shall ensure that their DLAs or DLAs of their LSPs at on-boarding stage itself prominently displays information relating to the loan product including features, loan limit and cost, etc., so as to make the customers aware of these aspects.</p><p><strong>(e)</strong> A facility of lodging complaint shall also be made available on the DLAs used by an RE / lender.</p><p><strong>(f)</strong> RE / lender shall provide a ‘Key Fact Statement’ (“KFS”) to the customers before the execution of the contract in a standardized format for all digital lending products.</p><p><strong>(g)</strong> RE / lender should publicly make available their or their LSPs privacy policies on their DLA.</p><p>1.2 Digital Lending Guidelines also impose certain additional obligations and restrictions in relation to digital lending. Some of the key restrictions and compliance requirements are set out below:</p><p><strong>(a)</strong> <strong>Restrictions on usage of third-party accounts</strong>: A restriction is placed on disbursals or repayments, or loan servicing being routed through or pooled in the accounts of any third parties. RE / lenders are required to ensure that all repayments are made by the customers directly into their bank accounts and similarly all disbursals are made into the bank accounts of the customers. The only exceptions to the above considered are: (i) disbursals covered exclusively under statutory or regulatory mandate (of RBI or of any other regulator); (ii) flow of money between REs for co-lending transactions; (iii) disbursals for specific end use, provided the loan is disbursed directly into the bank account of the end-beneficiary; and (iv) Where a physical interface is used for recovery of delinquent loans.</p><p><strong>(b)</strong> <strong>Obligations before and during loan execution</strong>: A KFS in a standardised format, detailing aspects like the annual percentage rate (“APR”), recovery mechanisms, grievance redressal contacts, and the cooling-off period available to the customer must be provided. Loan documents, such as KFS, loan summaries, sanction letters, and terms and conditions, must be digitally signed and automatically sent to customers upon loan agreement execution.</p><p><strong>(c)</strong> <strong>Data Collection</strong>: RE / lender must ensure that data collection through their DLAs or DLAs of LSPs must be on a need-based manner, with explicit consent of the customers. Audit trails must be maintained in relation to collection of data from customers. Customers must be provided with the options to restrict data usage, revoke consent, and request data deletion.
